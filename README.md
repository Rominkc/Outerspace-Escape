# Outerspace-Escape
Android based mobile game written in Lua with Corona SDK
The objective of the game is to dodge objects that appear at the top of the screen. 
You gradually change colors, and "power up" as your score increases; however, you lose when your score reaches -1000.
Thank you for playing
